# Predictive Model for Insurance Client Churn

## Overview
This project aims to predict client churn in the insurance industry using various machine learning models. By analyzing client behavior and transaction data, we can identify patterns that may indicate the likelihood of a client discontinuing their policy. The insights generated can help in developing targeted retention strategies.

## Model Evaluation
Each model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were also generated to visualize the classification results.

## Results
The results of each model were compiled into a comparison table, showcasing the accuracy and performance of each model on the test dataset.
